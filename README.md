# Planetary_Intruders
A game for Arduboy based on Space Invaders.

Please note: This is an old project I created a while ago when I was really really bad at coding, so expect obfocussed and spaghetti code all over the place.
Also expect it to run slow on your Arduboy because I didn't know how to optimise code correctly back then.
